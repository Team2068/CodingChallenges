## FizzBuzz

For the integer numbers from `1` to `100` do the following:

- If the number is divisible by 3, print `fizz`
- If the number is divisible by 5, print `buzz`
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print `fizzbuzz`
- If the number is divisible by neither 3 nor 5 print the number itself, e.g. `4`.

The first few lines of output would be:

```
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
6
7
```

## Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Diagonal Sums

Given a "square" array of subarrays, find the sum of values from the first value of the first array, the second value of the second array, the third value of the third array, and so on...

Example 1: given the following "square" array:

```
[[1, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1]]
```
The solution would be `4`

Example 2:

```
[[1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
```

The solution would be `9`
